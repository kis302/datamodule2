      Actor – Telugu. In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which
      received positive reviews upon release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star
      rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from
      his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the
      director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes
      out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and
      logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover
      until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of
      fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some
      touching moments."
      <br />
      [27] In 2011, he appeared in another romantic comedy Mr. Perfect. The
      review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The

      Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence.
      Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core
      Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in
      content".[29] Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for
      the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans.
      Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of
      Prabhas."[30] Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie 1.5 stars
      out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava
      Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for
      the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience.
      <br />
      "[31] He also rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina
      Ready (2012).[32] In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of
      Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half
      of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episodes which occupies the lion's share of
      the second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of
      the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi
      has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[33] Mahesh S Koneru
      gave his verdict that "At the box office, the film will turn in a good
      commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[34] Way2movies
      also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the
      show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[35]
      SuperGoodMovies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go
      and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both class and mass. It is a worth
      watch."[36] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination
      for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He then made his Hindi
      cinema debut in 2014 in the special dance number "Punjabi Mast" from the
      film Action Jackson.[37]
